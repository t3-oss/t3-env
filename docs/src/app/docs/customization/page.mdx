# Customization

Below are some examples of how you can customize the behavior of the library. The default values are shown in the snippets below.

## Skipping validation

<Callout type="warning">

Skipping validation is not encouraged and will lead to your types and runtime values being out of sync. It is available to let you opt out of validation during linting (or similar), or if you're building with Docker and not all environment variables are present when building the image.

</Callout>

```ts title="src/env.ts"
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-core";

export const env = createEnv({
  // ...
  // Tell the library to skip validation if condition is true.
  skipValidation: false,
});
```

## Overriding the default error handler

```ts title="src/env.ts"
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-core";

export const env = createEnv({
  // ...
  // Called when the schema validation fails.
  onValidationError: (issues: StandardSchemaV1.Issue[]) => {
    console.error(
      "❌ Invalid environment variables:",
      issues
    );
    throw new Error("Invalid environment variables");
  },
  // Called when server variables are accessed on the client.
  onInvalidAccess: (variable: string) => {
    throw new Error(
      "❌ Attempted to access a server-side environment variable on the client"
    );
  },
});
```

## Tell when we're in a server context

```ts title="src/env.ts"
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-core";

export const env = createEnv({
  // ...
  // Tell the library when we're in a server context.
  isServer: typeof window === "undefined",
});
```

## Treat empty strings as undefined

By default, T3 Env will feed the environment variables directly to the Zod validator. This means that if you have an empty string for a value that is supposed to be a number (e.g. `PORT=` in a ".env" file), Zod will flag
it as a type mismatch violation. Additionally, if you have an empty string for a value that is supposed to be a string with a default value (e.g. `DOMAIN=`in an ".env" file), the default value will never be applied. In order to solve these issues, you can set the`emptyStringAsUndefined`option to`true`.

```ts title="src/env.ts"
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-core";

export const env = createEnv({
  // ...
  // Treat empty strings as undefined.
  emptyStringAsUndefined: false,
});
```

## Extending presets

Your env object may extend other presets by using the `extends` property. This can be used to include system environment variables for your deployment provider, or if you have a monorepo with multiple packages that share some environment variables.

```ts title="src/env.ts"
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-core";
import { vercel } from "@t3-oss/env-core/presets";

export const env = createEnv({
  // ...
  // Extend the Vercel preset.
  extends: [vercel()],
});

env.VERCEL_URL; // string
```

T3 Env ships the following presets out of the box, all importable from the `/presets` entrypoint.

- `vercel` - Vercel environment variables. See full list [here](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables#system-environment-variables).
- `neonVercel` - Neon provided system environment variables when using the Vercel integration. See full list [here](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/vercel-native-integration#environment-variables-set-by-the-integration).
- `uploadthing` - All environment variables required to use [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com/). More info [here](https://docs.uploadthing.com/getting-started/appdir#add-env-variables).
- `render` - Render environment variables. See full list [here](https://docs.render.com/environment-variables#all-runtimes).
- `railway` - Railway provided system environment variables. See full list [here](https://docs.railway.app/reference/variables#railway-provided-variables).
- `fly.io` - Fly.io provided machine runtime environment variables. See full list [here](https://fly.io/docs/machines/runtime-environment/#environment-variables).
- `netlify` - Netlify provided system environment variables. See full list [here](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables).

<Callout type="info">
  Feel free to open a PR with more presets!
</Callout>

A preset is just like any other env object, so you can easily create your own:

```ts
// packages/auth/env.ts
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-core";
export const env = createEnv({
  // ...
});

// apps/web/env.ts
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-nextjs";
import { env as authEnv } from "@repo/auth/env";

export const env = createEnv({
  // ...
  extends: [authEnv],
});
```
