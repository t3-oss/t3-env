Fumadocs UI is the built-in user interface integration for Fumadocs, built on the top of Radix UI.

## Automatic Installation

Create a new app with `create-fumadocs-app`.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-fumadocs-app
# or
pnpm create fumadocs-app
# or
yarn create fumadocs-app
```

## Manual Installation

Create a new Next.js application with `create-next-app`, and install required packages.

```package-install
fumadocs-ui fumadocs-core
```

### Configuration

Fumadocs UI is unopinionated and doesn't include content management features by default.
You can choose a source you prefer, such as Contentlayer and Fumadocs MDX.

There is a list of supported sources:

- [Setup Fumadocs MDX](/docs/mdx)
- [Setup Contentlayer](/docs/headless/contentlayer)

You have to configure the library correctly following their setup guide before continuing.

### Styles

You can import the pre-built stylesheet in the root layout.

```ts
import 'fumadocs-ui/style.css';
```

For Tailwind CSS projects, you may use [the official plugin](/docs/ui/theme) instead.

> It doesn't come with a default font, you may choose one from `next/font`.

### Root Layout

Wrap the entire application inside [Root Provider](/docs/ui/blocks/root-provider).

```tsx
import { RootProvider } from 'fumadocs-ui/provider';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <RootProvider>{children}</RootProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Layout

Create a new catch-all route for our docs, and give it a proper layout.

```tsx title="app/docs/layout.tsx"
import { DocsLayout } from 'fumadocs-ui/layout';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function RootDocsLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <DocsLayout tree={tree} nav={{ title: 'My App' }}>
      {children}
    </DocsLayout>
  );
}
```

> `tree` refers to [Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree), which should be provided by your data source.

### Page

For the `page.tsx`, it may vary depending on your source. You should manually configure static rendering with `generateStaticParams` and metadata with `generateMetadata`.

Make sure to wrap your content in the [Page](/docs/ui/blocks/page) component, this will also configure typography styles.

### Search

By default, it uses the built-in document search based on Flexsearch. [Learn to configure Document Search](/docs/headless/search/flexsearch) for your data source.

## Enjoy!

Now, Create your first mdx file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see http://localhost:3000/docs.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### FAQ

<Accordions>
<Accordion id='why-fumadocs-ui' title="Why Fumadocs UI?">

Fumadocs UI provides many built-in components, and is more flexible compared to
other existing frameworks.

And most importantly, it is compatible with Next.js App Router which results in
a faster page load speed with ~120kb initial Javascript load. You can easily use
Fumadocs in an existing Next.js project, without refactoring anything.

Feel free to open the demo in CodeSandbox and see if it suits you.

</Accordion>
<Accordion id='fix-supports-color' title="How to fix 'supports-color' error?">

If you got this error:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'supports-color' in '.../node_modules/debug/src'
```

Try installing `supports-color@8.1.1`.

</Accordion>
<Accordion id='fix-dot-map-error' title="How to fix '@/.map' error?">

If you are using Fumadocs MDX, the `.map.ts` file will be generated automatically once you start the dev server.

For more information, see [Setup Guide](/docs/mdx).
