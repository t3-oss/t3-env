description: The structure of page tree.
---

Page tree is a tree that includes all the pages, separator and folders.

It will be sent to the client and being referenced in the sidebar or breadcrumb.
Hence, you shouldn't store any sensitive or large data in page tree.

<Callout title="Note">
  Unserializable data such as functions can't be passed to page tree.

## Conventions

### Root

The initial root of page trees.

```json doc-gen:typescript
{
  "file": "./content/docs/headless/props.ts",
  "name": "PageTreeRoot"
}
```

### Page

It contains a url, an optional icon and display name.

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "name": "Quick Start",
  "url": "/docs"
}
```

> External urls are also supported

```json doc-gen:typescript
{
  "file": "./content/docs/headless/props.ts",
  "name": "PageTreeItem"
}
```

### Folder

A folder containing a list of nodes.

```json
{
    "type": "folder",
    "name": "Guide",
    "index": {
        "type": "page",
        ...
    }
    "children": [
        ...
    ]
}
```

```json doc-gen:typescript
{
  "file": "./content/docs/headless/props.ts",
  "name": "PageTreeFolder"
}
```

#### As Root

To implement multiple page trees, you can add a `root` property to the folder node. The nearest root folder of current page will be used as the root of page tree.

### Separator

A label between items.

```json
{
  "type": "separator",
  "name": "Components"
}
```

```json doc-gen:typescript
{
  "file": "./content/docs/headless/props.ts",
  "name": "PageTreeSeparator"
}
```

## Icons

Icon is a `ReactElement`, supported by pages and folders.

## Type Bindings

You can import the type from server package.

```ts
import type { PageTree } from 'fumadocs-core/server'

const tree: PageTree = ...
```
