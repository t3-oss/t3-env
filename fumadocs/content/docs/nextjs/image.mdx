title: Image Optimization
description: Adding images to your docs
---

Fumadocs MDX resolves images into static imports with [Remark Image](/docs/headless/mdx/remark-image).
Therefore, your images will be optimized automatically by the Next.js Image API.

```mdx
![Hello](./hello.png)

or in public folder

![Hello](/hello.png)
```

Yields:

```mdx
import HelloImage from './hello.png';

<img alt="Hello" src={HelloImage} />
```
