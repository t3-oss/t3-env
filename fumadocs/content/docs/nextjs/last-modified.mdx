title: Last Modified Time
description: Output the last modified time of a document

## Usage

This feature is not enabled by default, you can enable this in `next.config.mjs`. Notice that it only supports Git as version control.
When using `git`, please ensure you have Git installed on your local machine and the repository is not shallow cloned as it relies on your local Git history.

```js
import createMDX from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

const withMDX = createMDX({
  mdxOptions: {
    lastModifiedTime: 'git', // [!code highlight]
  },
});
```

### Access the Property

After doing this, a `lastModified` number will be exported for each document, you can convert it to a JavaScript Date object with `new Date(lastModified){:js}`.

```js
const page = getPage(...)

console.log(page.data.exports.lastModified)
```
